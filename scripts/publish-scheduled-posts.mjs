/**
 * Publishes the drafts whose publishedAt has arrived.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than a date filter on the site's query: the site is a
 * static export, and src/lib/blog/queries.ts deliberately has no
 * `publishedAt <= now()` clause, because a future-dated post would sit
 * invisible until some later build that might never happen. Keeping
 * "published in the CMS" and "visible on the site" the same thing is worth
 * more than scheduling, so scheduling is built the other way round: the post
 * stays a draft until its date, and then something publishes it for real.
 *
 * That something is this script. Publishing fires the Sanity webhook that
 * already drives .github/workflows/cms-rebuild.yml, so nothing here needs to
 * know how the site is built.
 *
 * No @sanity/client: same reasoning as src/lib/blog/client.ts — two HTTP calls
 * do not justify a dependency.
