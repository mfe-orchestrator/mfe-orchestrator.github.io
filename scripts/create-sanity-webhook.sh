# Creates the Sanity webhook that rebuilds this site when a post is published.
#
# The Studio is where content changes; the site is static HTML built by GitHub
# Actions. This webhook is the wire between the two: on every create, update or
# delete of a post or a category, Sanity POSTs to GitHub's repository_dispatch
# API with event_type "sanity-publish", which is what .github/workflows/
# cms-rebuild.yml listens for.
#
# It exists as a script rather than as instructions because two of the nine
# fields — the GROQ filter and the projection — are the ones that silently break
# the chain when mistyped: a wrong projection produces a 204 from GitHub and no
# build. `sanity hooks create` is no help; in the current CLI it only opens the
# Manage UI in a browser.
#
# Usage:
#
#   SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN=...  GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN=...  ./scripts/create-sanity-webhook.sh
#
# Neither token is read from a file, written to one, or echoed. Where they come
# from:
#
#   SANITY_AUTH_TOKEN     https://www.sanity.io/manage/project/jgs8u5dy/api
#                         → Tokens → Add API token, role Administrator. Only
#                         this script needs it; it is not used at build time.
#
#   GITHUB_DISPATCH_TOKEN https://github.com/settings/personal-access-tokens
#                         → fine-grained token, this repository only,
#                         Repository permissions → Contents: Read and write
#                         (that is what authorises repository_dispatch).
#                         NOTE: when it expires the blog stops updating itself;
#                         pushes and manual runs still deploy.
#
# Re-running is safe: it stops if a webhook already points at the same URL.

Now check it end to end:

  1. Publish (or re-publish) any post in the Studio.
  2. The webhook's attempt log should show 204:
     https://www.sanity.io/manage/project/jgs8u5dy/api/webhooks
  3. A "CMS rebuild" run should appear:
     https://github.com/mfe-orchestrator/mfe-orchestrator.github.io/actions

To test the GitHub half on its own, without touching content:

  gh api -X POST repos/mfe-orchestrator/mfe-orchestrator.github.io/dispatches \
    -f event_type=sanity-publish
NEXT
