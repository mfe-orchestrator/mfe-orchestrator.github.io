 * The person who writes the posts.

 * This type exists for one reason: an answer engine weighs a named human with
 * verifiable expertise more heavily than a corporate byline, and until now
 * every post was attributed to the Organization. The fields below are the ones
 * that end up in the Person node of a post's linked data — they are evidence,
 * not decoration, so leave one blank rather than filling it with something
 * that cannot be checked.
